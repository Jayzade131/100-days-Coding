//Day 67 coding Statement : Bricks Breaking
//
//For her next karate demonstration, Arunima will break some bricks.
//
//Arunima stacked three bricks on top of each other. Initially, their widths (from top to bottom) are W1,W2,W3.
//
//Arunima strength is S. Whenever she hits a stack of bricks, consider the largest kâ‰¥0 such that the sum of widths of the topmost k bricks does not exceed S; the topmost k bricks break and are removed from the stack. Before each hit, Arunima may also decide to reverse the current stack of bricks, with no cost.
//
//Find the minimum number of hits Arunima needs in order to break all bricks if she performs the reversals optimally. You are not required to minimize the number of reversals.
//
//Input
//
//The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
//
//The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers S, W1, W2 and W3.
//
//Output
//
//For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ? the minimum required number of hits.
